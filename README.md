## Configure

Here's an example of how to initialize the CKEditor
plugin with additional params:

```javascript
UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY = "demopublickey"; // set your Uploadcare public key
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'ru'; // define a locale of your preference
CKEDITOR.replace( 'editor1', {
  extraPlugins: 'uploadcare', // this enables the plugin
  toolbar: [
    // add Uploadcare button to the toolbar, e.g.:
    ['Bold', 'Italic', '-', 'NumberedList', 'BulletedList', '-', 'Link', 'Unlink', '-', 'Uploadcare']
  ]
});
```

Please note that you can deeply customize the Uploadcare Widget behavior.
This includes defining file sources, file validation and much more.
If that's what you want, please look through the [Uploadcare Widget][5]
and [javascript API][6] documentation.
